As an undergraduate at the College of William & Mary I majored in Chemistry and Computational & Applied Math and Statistics. I then worked in the lab of Dr. David Takeda at the National Cancer institute studying prostate cancer epigeneitcs. In 2022, I started medical school at CWRU and am now working on my PhD in Cancer Biology. My PhD research in the lab of Dr. Corey Speers focuses on identifying ways to increase the efficacy of radiation therapy in triple negative breast cancer. In my free time I enjoy racing marathons and baking.\n\n\nEducation\n\nCase Western Reserve University (2022-Present)\nMD/PhD Program (Medical Scientist Training Program)\nCollege of William & Mary\nBS in Computational & Applied Math & Statistics and Chemistry, summa cum laude\n\n\nHonors\n\nUniversity Hospitals Research Day Poster Competition Winner (2023)\nMerck Index Award (2020)\nBlanton Bruner Scholarship from the Virginia Academy of Sciences (2019)\nEagle Scout (2016)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
